# VanillaWithFlake
A Minecraft datapack to make slight tweaks and QOL improvements to Vanilla with no mods

## Current change list:

### Crafting

- Smooth Stone now has a crafting recipe (2 Stone Slabs vertically)

- All Stair recipes now yield 8 Stairs instead of 4

- Leather now has a crafting recipe (9 Rotten Flesh)

### Mobs

- Spiders and Cave Spiders now create Cobwebs periodically (Cave Spiders twice as fast as regular)

- The Ender Dragon now drops an Elytra upon death

- The first time a player kills the Ender Dragon it now spawns a Dragon Egg

## Current wish-list/not possible list:

### Blocks

- Redstone Torches no longer give light updates/emit light

### Crafting

- Add Recipe for Rockets for the Recipe book (currently seems bugged due to NBT tags on Rockets)

- Smelting Iron/Gold tools yields 1 Iron Nugget per Iron Ingot used in the crafting of the original item (Two nuggets for a sword, three for a pickaxe etc)

### Mechanics

- Remove Mending, and remove the repair penalty/anvil use count for Repairing items

### Mobs

- Zombies attack Horses and turn them into Zombie Horses (same as villagers)

- Horses stuck by lightning turn into Zombie Horses
 
- Mobs (Villagers?, Humanoids?) can ride Horses as a passenger, like boats

- Shulkers respawn naturally (Over time, on killing Dragon?)
